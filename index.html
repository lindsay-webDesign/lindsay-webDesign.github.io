    <h1>My Poem</h1>
    <h2>By Lindsay Whitman-Orlin</h2>
    <p>I went outside and <br>saw a little <em>fox</em></p>
    <p>The fox jumped into a <strong>box</strong></p>
    <p>I asked him where his mama had gone</p>
    <p>The fox said "<em>I dont know, she was just <br> on the lawn!"</em></p>
    <p>I told the fox Id wait with him <br>for his mother to return</p>
    <p>We heard some rustling in the leaves from a nearby fern</p>
    <p>"Maybe that's your mom." I told the fox</p>
    <p>The little fox was was so excited, he <strong>jumped</strong> out of his box</p>
    <p>Mama fox crawled out of the fern to reunite with her little fox</p>
    <p>The little fox went on to follow his mother and <br>went to the lake to eat some lox</p>
